How To Use TinyApp
- Register/Login
Users must be logged in to create new links, view them, and edit them.

- Just click Register, put in your email and password, and you're good to go.

- Create New Links
Either click Create a New Short Link in My URLs page, or Create New URL on navigation bar. Then simply enter the long URL you want to shorten.

- Edit or Delete Short Links
In My URLs, you can delete any link you want.

- You can also click Edit, and then enter a new long URL to update your link. It will be the same short URL, but redirect to an updated long URL.

- Use Your Short Link
The path to use any short link is /u/:shortLink. This will redirect you to the long URL.
